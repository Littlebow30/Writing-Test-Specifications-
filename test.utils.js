// Multipication

// create a funtion that takes two numbers and multiplys them
// the output should be the multiplication of both numbers
// this should be able to take both positive and negitve numbers 
// if only one number is given then we should multiply the number by itself.

// Concats Odds

// This fuction should take an multiple arrays of numbers 
// This fuction should take out the odd numbers and place them in another array.
// if the number is already in the array, we should not add it 
//we should expect the numbers to be lesast to greatest.
